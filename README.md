# Big Data in Geographic Information Systems - Project

Notebook 1.ipynb:

Perform hypothesis tests on the linear trends of gridded precipitation data
implementing the False Discovery Rate (FDR) approach described in Wilks (2016),
using the same data in order to be more confident in the correctness of the
implementation.

Notebook 2.ipynb:

Apply the FDR approach to temperature data from CMIP6 climate models to test the
significance of linear trends.

## Requirements

Main requirements: numpy, xarray, pandas, cartopy, tqdm, matplotlib,
statsmodels, ipywidgets

(Ipywidgets is only required for the final interactive visualization in both
notebooks.)
